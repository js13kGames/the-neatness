The following data structures and algorithms
were harmed in the making of this game:

* Digital differential analyzer (DDA) based on
  [Raycasting tutorial][ack1] by [Lode Vandevenne][ack2]
    * Explained beautifully by [OneLoneCoder][ack3] in his video
      [Super Fast Ray Casting in Tiled Worlds using DDA][ack4]
* Scanline flood fill inspired by Pavel Kukov's q-floodfill
    * Which in turn cites
      [QuickFill: An Efficient Flood Fill Algorithm][ack5]
      by John R. Shaw
* Priority queue by [Francis Stokes][ack6] aka LowLevelJavaScript,
  see [Implementing A Generic Priority Queue][ack7]
* `A*` based on the excellent
  [Introduction to the `A*` Algorithm][ack8] by [Amit Patel][ack9]
